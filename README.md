   - **ArduinoJson** (by Benoit Blanchon) - for parsing weather data


### 🚀 Setup Steps

#### Step 1: Get OpenWeatherMap API Key

1. Go to [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Navigate to API Keys section in 
4. Copy your API key (looks like: `a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6`)

#### Step 2: Get location coordinates

1. Go to [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps)
2. Right-click on any location of choice
3. Copy the coordinates information (lat, lon)

#### Step 3: Configure the Code

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open the `arduino_code.ino` file in Arduino IDE
3. Update these lines with your information:

```cpp
// WiFi Credentials
const char* ssid = "YOUR_WIFI_NAME";
const char* password = "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD";

// OpenWeatherMap API
String apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE";

// Coordinates 
String lat = "<your lat>";
String lon = "<your lon>";
```

#### Step 4: Upload to ESP32

1. Connect ESP32 to your computer via USB
2. Select board: `Tools` → `Board` → `ESP32 Dev Module`
3. Select correct COM port: `Tools` → `Port` → `COMx` (Windows) or `/dev/ttyUSB0` (Linux/Mac)
4. Click the **Verify** button (✓) 
6. Click the **Upload** button (→)
7. Wait for "Done uploading" message

Note: it is best to sure the code runs with no errors before uploading it to the microcontroller (99% no errors would incur)

#### Step 5: Monitor Serial Output

1. Open Serial Monitor: `Tools` → `Serial Monitor`
2. Set baud rate to `115200` and `new line`
3. You should see connection status and weather data!

### 📊 Display Information

The OLED screen shows:
- 🌍 Condition
- 🌡️ Current temperature (°C)
- 🌡️ What it feels like (°C)
- 💧 Humidity percentage
- ☁️ Weather description
- 🕐 Auto / Manual (It will show manual when we use frontend to select the type of information we intend to view)

### 🎨 Customization

#### Change Temperature Unit
```cpp
// In the code, find this line and change it:
String units = "metric";   // For Celsius
// OR
String units = "imperial"; // For Fahrenheit
```

#### Change Update Interval
```cpp
// Default is 10 minutes (600000 milliseconds)
unsigned long updateInterval = 600000;  // Change this value
```

#### Change the location
In the serial monitor, the coordinates could be typed to change the location
```
LOC:xx.xx,xx.xx
```

### 🐛 Troubleshooting

#### Display Not Working
- Try connecting to 5V rail (common small modules run on 3.3V or 5V logic)
- Use GPIO4 and GPIO15 instead of GPIO21 and GPIO22, respectively (make similar changes in the Arduino_code)
- Verify I2C address is `0x3C` (or try `0x3D`)
- Test with I2C scanner sketch (available in the codes (index:5))


#### WiFi Connection Failed
- ✅ Double-check SSID and password (case-sensitive!)
- ✅ Make sure WiFi is 2.4GHz (ESP32 doesn't support 5GHz)
- ✅ Check if WiFi has special characters in password
- ✅ Try moving ESP32 closer to router

#### API Not Responding
- ✅ Verify API key is correct
- ✅ Check city name spelling
- ✅ Ensure you have internet connection
- ✅ Wait a few minutes (new API keys can take time to activate)
- ✅ Check API usage limits (free tier has limits)

#### Code Won't Upload
- ✅ Hold `BOOT` button on ESP32 while uploading
- ✅ Check USB cable (some cables are power-only)
- ✅ Select correct COM port
- ✅ Try a different USB port
- ✅ Install CH340/CP2102 drivers if needed

### 📖 How It Works

1. **WiFi Connection**: ESP32 connects to your WiFi network
2. **API Request**: Sends HTTP GET request to OpenWeatherMap API
3. **JSON Parsing**: Receives and parses JSON response
4. **Display Update**: Extracts weather data and updates OLED screen
5. **Loop**: Waits for update interval, then repeats
